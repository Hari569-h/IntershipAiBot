# Security Guide for API Keys and Credentials

## ⚠️ Important Security Notice

We've detected that actual API keys and credentials were committed to the repository. This is a security risk as:

1. API keys can be used to access paid services, potentially resulting in unexpected charges
2. Credentials can be used to access your accounts
3. Even if a repository is private, these secrets can be exposed through various means

## Actions Taken

The following actions have been taken to address the security issue:

1. Removed actual API keys and credentials from `.env` file
2. Updated `.env.example` to include all required environment variables with placeholder values
3. Ensured `.gitignore` is properly configured to ignore `.env` files

## Best Practices for Handling Secrets

### 1. Never Commit Secrets to Version Control

- **DO NOT** include actual API keys, passwords, or other secrets in any files that are committed to version control
- This includes `.env` files, configuration files, and code files

### 2. Use Environment Variables

- Store secrets as environment variables
- Use a `.env` file locally (which is ignored by git)
- Copy from `.env.example` to create your `.env` file

### 3. Use Secret Management Services

- For GitHub Actions: Use [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)
- For other deployment platforms: Use their built-in secret management

### 4. Rotate Compromised Secrets

If you've accidentally committed secrets to a public repository:

1. **Immediately rotate (change) all exposed secrets**
2. Check service dashboards for any unauthorized usage
3. Remove the secrets from the git history (though assume they've been compromised)

## Setting Up Your Environment

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` to add your actual API keys and credentials

3. **NEVER** commit the `.env` file to git

## Using GitHub Actions Securely

For the GitHub Actions workflows in this project:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to Secrets and Variables > Actions
3. Add each required secret (OPENAI_API_KEY, GROQ_API_KEY, etc.)

The workflows will automatically use these secrets without exposing them in logs or outputs.
